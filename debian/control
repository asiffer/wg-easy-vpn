Description: A command line tool to ease WireGuard VPN setup
 wg-easy-vpn is a tool designed to ease the set-up of a
 WireGuard (https://www.wireguard.com/) VPN. 
 In particular you can easily create a server
 and then add clients. You can also export the clients
 configurations through QR codes.
 When your vpn is set up, you just have to invoke `wg-quick`
 for instance.
